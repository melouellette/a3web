      <h3>Melanie Ouellette</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">CEO & Founder</p>
      <p>Melanieâ€™s past work history has focused on outreach and terrestrial ecology. She has
        gained valuable work experience at Conservation Halton as the Terrestrial Monitoring
        and Outreach Assistant. She assisted in ecological field work and data collection in
        support of the Long-term Environmental Monitoring Program and Species at Risk recovery
        projects, including such tasks as vegetation inventories and sampling, forest health
        monitoring and breeding birds surveys. She also assisted stewardship staff with the 
        delivery of outreach events, workshops and activities related to restoration.</p>
        <p> 
        Melanie has also worked with Natural Resources Canada as a Forest Research Assistant at the 
        Petawawa Research Forest. She calibrated and tested out new equipment in the field to 
        assist in forest measurement tasks; performed stand assessments, data collection of the
        Permanent Sample Plots, and Stem Mapping for the GeoSLAM Ground Lidar project; and 
        created maps for the tree plant assessment plots, and the volunteer tree plant using

      <h3>Shane Minor</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Project Manager and GIS Analyst</p>
      <p>Shane's background in Environmental Science and Biology provides a strong foundation for 
        his role as GIS Analyst. Before his time at MISK, Shane was a student at Carleton University 
        where he earned his Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science concentrating in Biology. 
        His time at Carleton exposed him to a variety of knowledge in environmental and ecological 
        processes through both laboratory and field work. Upon receiving his degree, Shane has continued 
        his studies to obtain a certificate in Geographic Information Systems from Fleming College. 
        Shane has previously worked for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. There, he expanded his 
        professional experience and his knowledge in biodiversity while digitizing specimens in the 
        Canadian National Collection of Insects, Arachnids, and Nematodes. Shane is passionate about 
        learning and seeks new ways to apply that learning in his work.
